## Fundamentals

### Stack

`SSV.Network` is a decentralized P2P network, consists of operator nodes grouped in multiple subnets.

The networking layer is built with [Libp2p](https://libp2p.io/), 
a modular framework for P2P networking that is used by multiple decentralized projects, including eth2.

### Transport

Network peers should support the following transports:
- `TCP` is used by libp2p for setting up communication channels between peers. default port: `12001`
- `UDP` is used for discovery purposes. default port: `13001`

[go-libp2p-noise](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-noise) 
is used to secure transport (see [noise protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html)).

Multiplexing of protocols over channels is achieved using [yamux](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-yamux) protocol.

### Messaging

Messages in the network are formatted with `protobuf` (NOTE: `v0` messages are encoded/decoded with JSON),
and being transported p2p with one of the following methods:

**Streams** 

Libp2p allows to create a bidirectional stream between two peers and implement the corresponding wire messaging protocol. \
See more information in [IPFS specs > communication-model - streams](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVqNrDfr2dxzQUo4VN3zhG4NV78uYFmRpgSktWDc2eeh2/specs/7-properties/#71-communication-model---streams).

Streams are used for direct messages between peers.

**PubSub**

GossipSub ([v1.1](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md)) 
is the pubsub protocol used in `SSV.Network`

The main purpose is for broadcasting messages to a group (AKA subnet) of nodes. \
In addition, the machinery helps to determine liveliness and maintain peers scoring.


### Network Peers

There are several types of nodes in the network:

`Operator` is responsible for executing validators duties. \
It holds relevant registry data and the validators consensus data.

`Bootnode` is a public peer which is responsible for helping new peers to find other peers in the network.
It has a stable ENR that is provided with default configuration, so other peers could join the network easily.

`Exporter` is a public peer that is responsible for collecting and exporting information from the network. \
It collects registry data and consensus data (decided messages) of all the validators in the network. \
It has a stable ENR that is provided with default configuration, 
so it will have a stable connection with all peers and won't be affected by scoring, pruning, backoff etc.


### Identity

Identity in the network is based on two types of keys:

`Network Key` is used to create network/[libp2p identity](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id) (`peer.ID`), 
will be used by all network peers to setup a secured connection. \
Unless provided, the key will be generated and stored locally for future use, 
and can be revoked in case it was compromised. 

`Operator Key` is used for decryption of share's keys that are used for signing/verifying consensus messages and duties. \
Exporter and Bootnode does not hold this key.

In addition, Operator nodes will expose an `Operator ID` that is calculated from the operator public key, 
and helps to identify a peer in the network.

### Network Discovery

[discv5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md) 
is used in `SSV.Network` as the discovery system.

More information is available in [Networking > Discovery](#discovery)


### Peer Scoring

The peer scoring in `SSV.Network` consists of the following types of scorers:

- [Connection Scoring](#connection-scoring) - calculated during handshake, affects the peers we connect to
- [Message Scoring](#message-scoring) - tracks operators behavior w.r.t incoming IBFT messages
- [Pubsub Scoring](#pubsub-scoring) - calculated by libp2p, tracks over gossip tasks and pubsub related metrics

For more info please refer to the linked sections.

------


## Wire

Network interaction includes several types of protocols:

## Consensus Protocol

`IBFT`/`QBFT` consensus protocol is used to govern `SSV` network.
`IBFT` ensures that consensus can be reached by a committee of `n` 
operator nodes while tolerating a certain amount of `f` faulty nodes as defined by `n â‰¥ 3f + 1`.

As part of the algorithm, nodes are exchanging messages with other nodes in the committee. \
Once the committee reaches consensus, the nodes will publish the decided message across the network.

Consensus messages are being sent in the network over pubsub topics (see [subnets](#subnets))

More information regarding the protocol can be found in [iBFT annotated paper (By Blox)](/ibft/IBFT.md)

### Message Structure

`SignedMessage` is a wrapper for IBFT messages, it holds a message and its signature with a list of signer IDs:

<details>
  <summary><b>protobuf</b></summary>
  
  ```protobuf
  syntax = "proto3";
  import "gogo.proto";
  
  // SignedMessage holds a message and it's corresponding signature
  message SignedMessage {
    // message is the IBFT message
    Message message            = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    // signature is a signature of the IBFT message
    bytes signature            = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
    // signer_ids is a sorted list of the IDs of the signing operators
    repeated uint64 signer_ids = 3;
  }
  
  // Message represents an IBFT message
  message Message {
    // type is the IBFT state / stage
    Stage type        = 1;
    // round is the current round where the message was sent
    uint64 round      = 2;
    // identifier is the message identifier
    bytes identifier      = 3;
    // sequence number is an incremental number for each instance, much like a block number would be in a blockchain
    uint64 seq_number = 4;
    // value holds the message data in bytes
    bytes value       = 5;
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>JSON example</b></summary>

  ```json
  {
    "message": {
      "type": 3,
      "round": 1,
      "identifier": "OTFiZGZjOWQxYzU4NzZkYTEwY...",
      "seq_number": 28276,
      "value": "mB0aAAAAAAA4AAAAAAAAADpTC1djq..."
    },
    "signature": "jrB0+Z9zyzzVaUpDMTlCt6Om9mj...",
    "signer_ids": [2, 3, 4]
  }
  ```
</details>

**NOTE:** 
- all pubsub messages in the network are wrapped with libp2p's message structure
- `signer_ids` must be sorted, to allow hashing the entire message

---

## Sync Protocols

There are several sync protocols, tha main purpose is to enable operator nodes to sync past decided message or to catch up with round changes.

In order to participate in some validator's consensus, a peer will first use sync protocols to align on past information.

Sync is done over streams as pubsub is not suitable in this case due to several reasons such as:
- API nature is request/response, unlike broadcasting in consensus messages
- Bandwidth - only one peer (usually) needs the data, it would be a waste to send redundant messages across the network.

### Message Structure

`SyncMessage` structure is used by all sync protocols, the type of message is specified in a dedicated field:


<details>
  <summary><b>protobuf</b></summary>

  ```protobuf
  message SyncMessage {
    // type is the type of sync message
    SyncMsgType type                      = 1;
    // identifier of the message (validator + role)
    bytes identifier                      = 2;
    // params holds the requests parameters
    repeated uint64 params                = 3;
    // messages holds the results (decided messages) of some request
    repeated proto.SignedMessage messages = 4;
    // error holds an error response if exist
    string error                          = 5;
  }
  
  // SyncMsgType is an enum that represents the type of sync message 
  enum SyncMsgType {
    // GetHighestType is a request from peers to return the highest decided/ prepared instance they know of
    GetHighestType       = 0;
    // GetInstanceRange is a request from peers to return instances and their decided/ prepared justifications
    GetInstanceRange     = 1;
    // GetCurrentInstance is a request from peers to return their current running instance details
    GetLatestChangeRound = 2;
  }
  ```
</details>

A successful response message usually includes a list of results and the corresponding message type and identifier:
```
{
  "messages": [ ... ],
  "type": <type>,
  "identifier": "..."
}
```

An error response includes an error code in the form of a string to allow flexibility:
```
{
  "identifier": "...",
  "type": <type>,
  "error": "EntryNotFoundError"
}
```

The following error codes exist: **TBD**
- `EntryNotFoundError` is returned when no results were found
- `InternalError` is returned upon internal error

### Protocols

SSV nodes use the following stream protocols:

### 1. Highest Decided

This protocol is used by a node to find out what is the highest decided message for a specific validator.
In case there are no decided messages, it will return an empty array of messages.

`/ssv/sync/decided/highest/0.0.1`

<details>
  <summary>examples</summary>

  Request:
  ```json
  {
    "identifier": "...",
    "type":   0,
  }
  ```

  Response:
  ```json
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "message": {
          "type": 3,
          "round": 1,
          "identifier": "...",
          "seq_number": 7943,
          "value": "Xmcg...sPM="
        },
        "signature": "g5y....7Dv",
        "signer_ids": [1,2,4]
      }
    ],
    "type": 0,
    "identifier": "..."
  }
  ```
</details>

### 2. Decided By Range

This protocol enables to sync decided messages in some specific range.

The request should specify the desired range, while the response will include all the found messages for that range.

`/ssv/sync/decided/range/0.0.1`

<details>
  <summary>examples</summary>
  
  Request:
  ```json
  {
    "identifier": "...",
    "params": [1200, 1225],
    "type":   1,
  }
  ```

  Response:
  ```json
  {
    "identifier": "...",
    "params": [1200, 1225],
    "messages": [
      {
        "message": {
          "type": 3,
          "round": 1,
          "identifier": "...",
          "seq_number": 1200,
          "value": "Xmcg...sPM="
        },
        "signature": "g5y....7Dv",
        "signer_ids": [1,2,4]
      },
      // ... 1201-1224
      {
        "message": {
          "type": 3,
          "round": 1,
          "identifier": "...",
          "seq_number": 1225,
          "value": "Xmcg...sPM="
        },
        "signature": "g5y....7Dv",
        "signer_ids": [1,2,4]
      }
    ],
    "type":   1,
  }
  ```
</details>


### 3. Last Change Round

This protocol enables a node to catch up with change round messages.

`/ssv/sync/last_change_round/0.0.1`

<details>
  <summary>examples</summary>
  
  Request:
  ```json
  {
    "identifier": "...",
    "params": [7554],
    "type":   2,
  }
  ```

  Response:
  ```json
  {
    "identifier": "...",
    "params": [7554],
    "messages": [
      {
        "message": {
          "type": 4,
          "round": 6,
          "identifier": "...",
          "seq_number": 7554,
          "value": "Xmcg...sPM="
        },
        "signature": "g5y....7Dv",
        "signer_ids": [1]
      }
    ],
    "type":   2,
  }
  ```
</details>

---

## Handshake protocol

`/ssv/handshake/0.0.1`

The handshake protocol allows peers to identify, by exchanging signed information. \
It must be performed for every connection, and therefore forces nodes to 
authenticate / prove ownership of their operator key.

**TBD** Public, static nodes such as exporter requires registration

### Message Structure

The following information will be exchanged as part of the handshake:

<details>
  <summary><b>protobuf</b></summary>

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
import "gogo.proto";

// HandshakeMessage is a message that is used for handshaking nodes
message HandshakeMessage {
  // payload is the information to sign in bytes
  bytes payload = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // signed is a signature of the message
  bytes signed  = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}

// HandshakePayload contains the information passed during handshake
message HandshakePayload {
  // identity is the information of the answering node
  NodeIdentity identity = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = true];
  // src is set by the sender
  Source src            = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}

// Source contains information from initiator of the handshake
message Source {
  // msg_seq helps to keep track over multiple handshakes, will by set by the sender
  uint64 msg_seq = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // peer_id is the peer that the message is targeted for, will by set by the sender
  bytes peer_id  = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
}

// NodeIdentity contains node's identity information
message NodeIdentity {
  // peer_id of the authenticating node
  bytes peer_id       = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // operator_id of the authenticating node
  bytes operator_id   = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = true];
  // node_type is the type of the authenticating node
  uint64 node_type    = 3 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];
  // fork_version is the current fork used by the node
  uint32 fork_version = 4;
  // metadata is the NodeMetadata in bytes, to allow future flexibility
  bytes metadata      = 5;
}

// NodeMetadata contains node's general information
message NodeMetadata {
  // execution_node is the "name/version" of the eth1 node
  string execution_node  = 1;
  // consensus_node is the "name/version" of the eth2 node
  string consesnsus_node = 2;
  // fork_version is the current ssv-node version
  string node_version    = 3;
}

```
</details>

## Networking

### Pubsub

The main purpose is for broadcasting messages to a group (AKA subnet) of nodes. \
In addition, the following are achieved as well:

- subscriptions metadata helps to get liveliness information of nodes
- pubsub scoring enables to prune bad/malicious peers based on network behavior and application-specific rules

The following parameters are used for initializing pubsub:

- `floodPublish` was turned on for better reliability, as peer's own messages will be propagated to a larger set of peers 
  (see [Flood Publishing](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#flood-publishing)) 
- `peerOutboundQueueSize` / `validationQueueSize` were increased to `600`, to avoid dropped messages on bad connectivity or slow processing
- `directPeers` includes the exporter peer ID, to ensure it gets all messages
- `subscriptionFilter` was injected to ensure a peer will connect to relevant topics, see [SubscriptionFilter](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/blob/master/subscription_filter.go) interface
- (fork `v1`) `msgID` is a custom function that calculates a `msg-id` based on the message content hash. 
The default function uses the `sender` + `msg_seq` which we don't track, and enforces signature / verification for each message. 
As all the messages are being verified using the share key, it would be redundant to it also in the pubusb level.
Moreover, the default `msg-id` duplicates messages, causing it to be processed more than once, in case it was sent by multiple peers (e.g. decided message).
- (fork `v1`) `signPolicy` was set to `StrictNoSign` (required for custom `msg-id`) to avoid producing and verifying message signatures in the pubsub router
  - `signID` was set to empty (no author)

### Pubsub Scoring

`gossipsub v1.1` introduced pubsub [scoring](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#peer-scoring),
the idea is that each individual peer maintains a score for other peers. 
The score is locally computed by each individual peer based on observed behaviour and is not shared.

`SSV.network` injects application specific scoring to apply connection and message scoring as part of pubsub scoring system. \
See [Connection Scoring](#connection-scoring) and [Message Scoring](#message-scoring) for more information.

Score thresholds are used by libp2p to determine whether a peer should be removed from topic's mesh, penalized or even ignored if the score drops too low. \
See [this section](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#score-thresholds) for more details regards the different thresholds. \
Thresholds values **TBD**, this section will be updated once that work is complete:

- `gossipThreshold`: -4000
- `publishThreshold`: -8000
- `graylistThreshold`: -16000
- `acceptPXThreshold`: 100
- `opportunisticGraftThreshold`: 5

[Score function](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#the-score-function) is 
running pariodically and will determine the score of peers. During heartbeat, the score it checked and bad peers are handled accordingly.


### Message Scoring

Message scorers track on operators' behavior w.r.t incoming IBFT messages:

- Invalid message signature (`-100`)
- Message from operator w/o shared committees (`-1000`)
- Late arrival of valid message (`-25`)

### Connection Scoring

Peer's connection score is determined after a successful handshake,
and peers with low score will be pruned.

Connection scores are based on the following properties:

- Shared subnets / committees (`25`)

### User Agent

Libp2p provides user agent mechanism with the [identify](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify) protocol, 
which is used to exchange basic information with other peers in the network.

User Agent contains the node version and type, and in addition the operator id. \
See detailed format in [forks > user agent](#fork-v0).

Note that user agent might be reduced in future versions,
but a short and simple user agent will be kept for libp2p interoperability. 

### Discovery

[discv5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md) is a system for finding other participants in a peer-to-peer network, 
it is used in `SSV.network` to complement discovery.

DiscV5 works on top of UDP, it uses a DHT to store node records (`ENR`) of discovered peers.
It allows walking randomly on the nodes in the table, and act according to application needs.

In SSV, new nodes are filtered by score, that is calculated from past behavior and properties (`ENR` entries). 
If the score is above threshold, the node tries to connect and handshake with the new node.

As discv5 is standalone (i.e. not depends on libp2p), the communication is encrypted and authenticated using session keys,
established in a separate [handshake process](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-theory.md#sessions).

**Bootnode** 

A peer that have a public, static ENR to enable new peers to join the network. For the sake of flexibility, 
bootnode/s ENR values are configurable and can be changed on demand by operators. \
Bootnode doesn't start a libp2p host for TCP communication, its role ends once a new peer finds existing peers in the network.

#### ENR

[Ethereum Node Records](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/enr.md) is a format that holds peer information.
Records contain a signature, sequence (for republishing record) and arbitrary key/value pairs. 

`ENR` structure in `SSV.Network` consists of the following key/value pairs:

| Key         | Value                                                          | Status          |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------|
| `id`        | name of identity scheme, e.g. "v4"                             | Done            |
| `secp256k1` | compressed secp256k1 public key, 33 bytes                      | Done            |
| `ip`        | IPv4 address, 4 bytes                                          | Done            |
| `tcp`       | TCP port, big endian integer                                   | Done            |
| `udp`       | UDP port, big endian integer                                   | Done            |
| `type`      | node type, integer; 1 (operator), 2 (exporter), 3 (bootnode)   | Done (`v0.1.9`) |
| `oid`       | operator id, 32 bytes                                          | Done (`v0.1.9`) |
| `version`   | fork version, integer                                          | -               |
| `subnets`   | bitlist, 0 for irrelevant and 1 for assigned subnet            | -               |

#### Discovery Alternatives

[libp2p's Kademlia DHT](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/kad-dht) offers similar features, 
and even a more complete implementation of Kademlia DHT.
Discv5 design is loosely inspired by the Kademlia DHT, but unlike most DHTs no arbitrary keys and values are stored. 
Instead, the DHT stores and relays only node records.

Libp2p's Kad DHT allows advertising and finding peers by values. \
In SSV the values would be the subnets of the operator, 
making it easier for other nodes to find it in case they share common subnets.

As `ENR` has a size limit (`< 300` bytes), 
discv5 won't support multiple key/value pairs for complementing this feature.
Instead, a bitlist is used as an array of flags, 
representing the assignment of subnets for an operator. 
Similar to how it implemented in Ethereum 2.0.

discv5 specifies [Topic Index](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-rationale.md#the-topic-index) 
which helps to lookup nodes by their advertised topics. In SSV these topics would be the operator's subnets. \ 
This hasn't been implemented yet, planned for [v5.2](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/milestone/3). 
For more information:
  - [DiscV5 Theory > Topic Advertisement](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-theory.md#topic-advertisement)
  - [discv5: topic index design thread](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/issues/136)

See [Ethereum specs > phase 0 > p2p interface](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#why-are-we-using-discv5-and-not-libp2p-kademlia-dht) 
for more details on why discv5 was chosen over libp2p Kad DHT in Ethereum.

In `v0` discv5 is used, `v1` TBD, this section will be updated once that work is complete.


### Network ID

Network ID is a `32byte` key, that is used to distinguish between other networks (ssv and others).
Peers from other public/private libp2p networks (with different network ID) won't be able to read or write messages in the network, 
meaning that the key to be known and used by all network members.

It is done with [libp2p's private network](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pnet/Private-Networks-PSK-V1.md),
which encrypts/decrypts all traffic with the corresponding key,
regardless of the regular transport security protocol ([go-libp2p-noise](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-noise)).

**NOTE** discovery communication (UDP) won't use the network ID, 
and it's not needed as unknown peers will be filtered.


### Subnets

Consensus messages are being sent in the network over a subnet (pubsub topic), which the relevant peers should be subscribed to.

#### Subnets - fork v0

`v0` was working with a simple approach, each validator committee has 
a dedicated pubsub topic with all the relevant peers subscribed to it (committee + exporter). \
It helps to reduce amount of messages in the network, 
but increases the number of topics which will grow up to the number of validators.

In order to provide more redundancy, there is a global topic (AKA `main topic`) to publish all the decided messages in the network.

#### Subnet - fork v1

A subnet of operators is responsible for multiple committees,
reusing the same topic to communicate on behalf of multiple validators.

In comparison to `v0`, the number of topics will be reduced and the number of messages sent over the network should grow. \
As messages will be propagated to a larger set of nodes, we can expect better reliability (arrival of messages to all operators in the committee).

In addition, a larger group of operators provides:
- redundancy of decided messages across multiple nodes
- better security for subnets as more nodes will validate messages and can score bad/malicious nodes that will be pruned accordingly.

Global/main topic is not needed in this solution and therefore will be reduced.

**Validators Mapping**

Validator's public key is mapped to a subnet using a hash function, 
which helps to distribute validators across subnets in a balanced way:

`hash(validatiorPubKey) % num_of_subnets`

Deterministic mapping is ensured as long as the number of subnets doesn't change, 
therefore it's a fixed number (TBD 32 / 64 / 128).

**TBD** A dynamic number of subnets (e.g. `log(num_of_peers)`) which requires a different approach.


### Peers Connectivity

In a fully-connected network, where each peer is connected to all other peers in the network,
running nodes will consume many resources to process all network related tasks e.g. parsing, peers management etc.

To lower resource consumption, the number of connected peers is limited, currently set to `250`. \
Once reached to peer limit, the node will connect only to relevant nodes with score above threshold, 
which is currently set to zero.


#### Connection Filters

Connection filters are executed upon new connection. \
Filters calculates the connection score of the new peer, and will terminate the connection if score is low.
In addition, it will mark the peer as pruned so following connections requests 
will be stopped at connection gater (see below).


#### Connection Gating

Connection Gating allows safeguarding against bad/pruned peers that tries to reconnect multiple times. 
Inbound and outbound connections are intercepted and being checked before other components process the connection.

See libp2p's [ConnectionGater](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core/blob/master/connmgr/gater.go) 
interface for more info.


### Forks

Future network forks will follow the general forks mechanism and design in SSV. \
The idea is to wrap procedures that have potential to be changed in future versions.

Currently, the following are covered:

- validator topic mapping
- message encoding/decoding
- user agent


#### Fork v0

**validator topic mapping**

Validator public key is used as the topic name:

`bloxstaking.ssv.<hex(validator-public-key)>`

**message encoding/decoding**

JSON is used for encoding/decoding of messages.

**user agent**

User Agent contains the node version and type, and in addition the operator id.

`SSV-Node:v0.x.x:<node-type>:<?operator-id>`

#### Fork v1 (TBD)

**validator topic mapping**

Validator public key hash is used to determine the validator's subnet which is the topic name:

`bloxstaking.ssv.<hash(validatiorPubKey) % num_of_subnets>`

**message encoding/decoding**

**TBD** check regards other encodings such as `SSZ` which is aligned with Ethereum, 
or `protobuf` that should show faster results than JSON.

**user agent**

User Agent in `v1` will be reduced in the favor of the handshake process.

A short and simple user agent is kept for acheiving libp2p interoperability.

`SSV-Node/v0.x.x`


### Security

The discovery system is naturally a good candidate for security problems. \
DiscV5 specs specifies potential vulnerabilities in their system, 
See (DiscV5 Rationale > security-goals)[https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-rationale.md#security-goals].
The major ones includes routing table pollution, traffic redirection, spamming or replayed messages. \
Some are less relevant to `SSV.Network` as messages are being verified in a higher level, 
by the IBFT components using the share public key, 
and therefore malicious messages will be identified as invalid.

The following measures are used to protect against malicious peers and denial of service attacks:
- Connection score is determined during discovery process, ensures that the node will try to connect only with relevant peers.
- Connection filters determine the score for inbound connections, and terminates low scored connections
- Connection gater protects against peers which were pruned in the past and tries to reconnect again before backoff timeout (5 min). 
it kicks in in an early stage, before the other components processes the request to avoid resources consumption.
